# Education-Analysis

The objective of this research project is to explore global education and literacy rates and understand how various factors, such as access to technology and basic amenities, impact education outcomes. To achieve this objective, two datasets were used, one focusing on global education and literacy rates, and another specifically on education in India. Data visualization techniques were used to analyze the data and identify patterns and trends.

The methods used in the project included data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Python programming language and various data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Different types of visualizations, such as bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps, were used to display the data and identify patterns and trends.

Overall, the results of this project demonstrate the power of data visualization techniques in analyzing and presenting complex education datasets. By using data visualization techniques such as bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and scatterplots, the data has been made more accessible and understandable, enabling policymakers, researchers, and educators to make more informed decisions about how to improve education and literacy rates worldwide.

The outcome of the project revealed several interesting insights about global education and literacy rates. Access to technology, basic amenities, and socio-economic factors was found to have a significant impact on education outcomes. Additionally, the project found that the global education rate has improved over time, but significant disparities still exist across different countries and regions.

The scope of this project is to contribute to the understanding of global education and literacy rates and inform decision-making to improve educational outcomes worldwide. The project findings can be used by policymakers, researchers, and educators to design effective interventions and programs to improve access to education and promote literacy.
